## Greeting in English, how to Answer the Question "How are you?"



* Welcome to English class 1 o 1 dot com 's English in Three Minutes, the fastest /ˈfæstɪst/, easiest /ˈiːziɪst/, and the most fun way to learn English. Hi, how's it going? I'm Alisha. Nice to meet you. In this series, we're going to learn some easy ways to ask and answer common questions in English. It's really useful, and it only takes three minutes.
* In this lesson, you're going to learn new, more common ways to ask and answer the question: "How are you?", in English. You've probably learned "How are you?" and "I'm fine" in textbooks before, but in the United States people will usually ask this question and answer it in a different way.
* First, let's review. If someone says "How are you?", You can say: "I'm fine". "I'm fine". Here are some other ways to answer: "Pretty good." - This means about the same thing as, "I'm fine", "Pretty good". We also have "Not bad." You can use this if you are feeling just okay, or so-so. "Not bad".
* Let's look at our question again: "How are you?", This is the most well-known way of asking how someone is. You could use it when you want to be polite. But now, let's look at some different ways to ask how someone is. These ways are more casual, and much more common.
* First, "Hey, how's it going?",  "Hey, how's it going?". You can answer this in many ways. If you're feeling good, you can say, "Good", "Good", "Pretty good.", "Pretty good.", "Not bad.", "Not bad.". Once more, "Good.", "Pretty good.", "Not bad.".
* Here's a tip! Even though these answers mean the thing as "I'm fine", you can't answer "How's it going?" with "I'm fine.", It will be sound a bit strange. If you're not feeling good, you can say: "Not so good", "Not so good", "Not great.", "Not great.", or, "Not so well.", "Not so well.". Be careful: If you say one of these, the other person usually ask, "Why, what's wrong?" to be polite. Then, you will have to explain.
* Another casual, but very common version of "How are you?" is "What's up?", "What's up?". To reply, use a cheerful voice as you say: "Not much.", "Not much.", or, "Nothing much.", "Nothing much.". This means you're free and able to chat. Since "What's up" is just another way of saying "Hello", you can also reply with: "Hey!", or, "Hi!"
* Now it's time for Alisha's advice. A lot of the time, when we ask questions that mean "how are you?" in English, we're not actually asking about the other person's health, we are only asking to be polite. You should think of these questions as another way of saying "Hello", a way for the conversation to get started instead of actual literal questions. In fact, when someone asks you "what's up?" you don't even have to answer! Just say "What's up?" in reply.
* Do you know the difference between "What do you do?" and "What are you doing?", It's a little tricky, but we'll explain it simply in the next English in Three Minutes lesson! See you next time.



## Asking About Occupations, What is you Job?

* Welcome to English class 1 o 1 dot com 's English in Three Minutes, the fastest, easiest and the most fun way to learn English. Hey every one, I'm Alisha. In this series, we're going to learn some easy ways to ask and answer common questions in English. It's really useful and it's only tasks three minutes. In this lesson, you are going to learn how to ask someone's job is in natural English.
* Of course, you can just say, "What is your job?", This is correct English, but it sounds too direct and awkward. Native English speaker almost never say this in social situation. Instead, they use a different question. But before we master that, we need to compare it to a very similer question. 
* "What are you doing?", "I'm presenting a video about English! "
* "What do you do?". "I'm a English teacher."
* Do you see the difference? This simale questions "What are you doing?" and "What do you do?" sound similar, but mean different things. 
* The first one is asking what you are doing right now, this minute. You answer it using an -ing verb.
* "What are you doing?", "I'm reading!",  "I'm watching TV!"
* The second is actually a shotern version of "What do you do for a living?", This is how we ask "What is your job?" in natural English. Let's practice this question. "What do you do." "What do you do.", When native speakers of English ask this question, It can come out very fast, and sound more like "What"
* In order tell it apart from"What are you doing?", Just listen for the "ing" sound on the end of question, if it not there, then you're being asked what your job is! So how would you answer this question.?Just think of it as if the other person is asking you, "What is your job?" You could answer with "I am", plus your job. "I'm a teacher" "I'm a teacher", or , "I'm a engineer", If you want to learn more job names, go to EnglishClass 1 o 1 dot com and check out the Core Word Lists.

* If you work for a , you can say "I work for", and then the name: "I work for Microsoft.", "I work for Microsoft.",  "I work for The New York Times." , "I work for The New York Times.", 
* Now it's time for Alisha's Advice!
* When you ask the question "What do you do?" and the other person answer therer job, it's polite to make some kind of positive comment about his or her job.
* For example, "How interesting!" or "That must be exciting"
